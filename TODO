* use library to parse config from env, flags and file
* add tests
* overall better organization

* Maybe adding support for adding layouts via config
  tmux supports passing a string which defines the dimensions of each pane
  in a window in a json-like structure.
  However these can only be used for exactly the number of panes used
  when generating this layout, so it is not exactly useful with variadic
  inpus.
